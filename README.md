# RivulEd Utilities

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to serve as utilities that help 
educators identify and download pedagogically useful *rivulets* of data from large, 
public data streams. 

## About RivulEd

The name *RivulEd* is a play on the word _rivulet_, indicating a small stream, combined 
with _Ed_ for _education_. It's an homage to Tim Erickson's idea of students being
[Awash in Data](https://codap.xyz/awash/), and an acknowledgement that while there are 
some powerful [Oceans of Data](https://oceansofdata.org/) out there, finding one that's 
manageable, interesting, and ready to use can be difficult.

These utilities are designed to highlight some features of datasets from particular 
domains that make them particularly intriguing and pedagogically productive, help
people access and assess subsets of major data streams that may have these 
properties and may also be local or otherwise relevant to particular students, and
gently introduce and support the user in developing skills related to accessing
and querying data, in the meantime.

The target audience for these tools are advanced beginners to intermediate users.
Educators who know and have used Python, and want to pull up some fresh and relevant
datasets for their students, but don't have the time to do it by themselves.
