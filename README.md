# Rivulet: Python Notebook Utilities for Pedagogically Useful Datasets

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to help educators and educational
desingers find and download pedagogically useful subsets of data from large, 
public data streams. 

## About Rivulet

The name *Rivulet*, indicating a small stream, of course is meant to refer to a small
but dynamic bit of larger available data streams. It's also a nod to Tim Erickson's 
idea of being [Awash in Data](https://codap.xyz/awash/), and an acknowledgement that 
while there are some powerful [Oceans of Data](https://oceansofdata.org/) out there, 
finding one that's manageable, interesting, and ready to use can be difficult or 
even overwhelming.

These utilities are designed to highlight some features of datasets from particular 
domains that make them particularly intriguing and pedagogically productive, help
people access and assess subsets of major data streams that may have these 
properties and may also be local or otherwise relevant to particular students, and
gently introduce and support the user in developing skills related to accessing
and querying data, in the meantime.

The target audience for these tools are advanced beginners to intermediate users.
Educators who know and have used Python, and want to pull up some fresh and relevant
datasets for their students, but don't have the time to do it by themselves.
